# üÉè for Mina Bootcamp

Current MINA problems:

1. Texas Hold'em is a long game. It's better to use multiple files to modularize the process.
   1. How to call other snapps on chain. Is there a smart contract list that we can use as tool?
   2. User and server should run different snapps can communicate with each other.
2. What should stay on-chain. How's the chain only 22KB?
3. Need more docs on `State<Field>`. It seems can only be read once?
4. How to send message to a specific account? I did Hash(`AccountPublicKey+Message`), but don't know where to post this message. Would be too many things on the chain if we do this every time dealing a card.

## Dev story

  Truly the status number will be much much fewer w/o shuffle.
